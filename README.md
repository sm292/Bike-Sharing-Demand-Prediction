In the present context of the project, the objective is to develop a predictive model which effectively predicts the count of rental cars depending on different variables like seasons, time and other factors. The data on the rented bike has different variables like the season, hour, humidity, and several environmental factors and the count of the bikes in every entry. This data provides an idea of how these different factors impact the count of bikes rented. The data analyses are the key objectives of the project and for this, different methods of exploratory data analyses are done. These analyses can help determine how these factors are related to the rented bike. This also provides insights into the business operations and some effective measures for business analysis are accomplished.

Another important aspect of the project is developing a hypothesis based on the exploratory data analysis. Three different hypotheses are developed and testing the hypothesis with chi-square and ANOVA tests (where appropriate), the hypothesis is verified.

The next phase of the project includes the development of a predictive model using different regression methods like linear, random forest and XGB regression. The accuracy scores of the different regression and Grid search Hyperparameter tuning accuracy scores have been compared. The prediction model is tested by predicting the values and comparing them with the test values which have been separated while the data split.
